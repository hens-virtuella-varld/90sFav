                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>
                    The origins of the Internet date back to a project under the
                    United States Department of Defense in the 60s.
                    <br />
                    The purpose was to enable users to share computing resources
                    at the same time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 1970s, the network served regional academic and
                    military networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, the Internet was widely used by academia in the 80s.
                    <br />
                    Meanwhile, worldwide development and the merger of networks
                    happened during this period due to contributions from
                    national funding as well as private commercial funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the early 1990s, the linking of commercial networks and
                    enterprises marked the beginning of the transition to the
                    modern Internet.
                    <br />
                    Gradually, the commercialisation incorporated Internet
                    services and technologies into virtually every aspect of
                    modern life.
