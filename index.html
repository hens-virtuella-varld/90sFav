                    <h2>Intro</h2>
                    <p>
                        The origins of the Internet date back to a project under
                        the United States Department of Defense in the 60s.
                        <br />
                        The purpose was to enable users to share computing
                        resources at the same time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the 1970s, the network served regional academic and
                        military networks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, the Internet was widely used by academia in the
                        80s.
                        <br />
                        Meanwhile, worldwide development and the merger of
                        networks happened during this period due to
                        contributions from national funding as well as private
                        commercial funds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the early 1990s, the linking of commercial networks
                        and enterprises marked the beginning of the transition
                        to the modern Internet.
                        <br />
                        Gradually, the commercialisation incorporated Internet
                        services and technologies into virtually every aspect of
                        modern life.
